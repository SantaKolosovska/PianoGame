# piano_game
This is a game for musical ear training. A piano keyboard and a Play button is displayed. 
When you press the Play button, a random note is played back. Then you have to find the 
corresponding note on the keyboard. For now the random note and each note you play are 
displayed in the console. The game is already playable as it is, you just need to resist 
the temptation to look at the console before you've found the corresponding note. 
Tip: when you've found the corresponding note, make sure it's the last played, so you'd 
know which one was it. The correct note will be printed when you press the Play button 
(e.g. "The correct answer is Do"). The notes for keys you press afterwards will be printed 
each time you press a key (e.g. "Si"). WARNING: Play button plays back a different sound 
each time it's being pressed, therefore you can't check again what was the sound being played. 

Future improvements:
- menu 
- checkboxes for submitting the answer (in process)
- displaying if answer was correct or not
- scoreboard
- game mode where you can collect points for correct answers 
- game mode with a timer that limits your time for finding the corresponding sound 
- game mode where points are calculated by how many times the user needed to press
keys to find the right note
- displaying accumulated points while playing 
- different color palettes to choose from
- instead of one also two or three octaves could be used 


- display chords (starting with simple major and minor chords)
- find chords by ear like in the note game (playing three notes at a time would be
too much to ask, so instead by pressing the root note the whole chord would be 
played back and displayed (by darkening corresponding keys keys).
